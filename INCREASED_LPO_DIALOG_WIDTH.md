# Increased Width of Supplier LPO View Dialog

## Summary
Increased the width of the view dialog in the "LPOs Ready for Generation" section of the Supplier LPO page to provide more space for displaying content, especially the newly added notes section.

## Change Made

### File Modified
- `client/src/pages/supplier-lpo.tsx`

### Implementation Details

#### Dialog Width Update
Changed the dialog container width from `max-w-2xl` to `max-w-5xl` for better content display.

**Before:**
```tsx
<DialogContent className="max-w-2xl">
```

**After:**
```tsx
<DialogContent className="max-w-5xl">
```

### Width Comparison

| Class      | Max Width | Pixels (approx) | Usage                    |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| max-w-2xl  | 42rem     | ~672px          | Previous (Small)         |
| max-w-5xl  | 64rem     | ~1024px         | Current (Larger)         |

**Increase:** ~52% wider (from 672px to 1024px)

## Benefits

### 1. **Better Content Display**
- More horizontal space for order items
- Notes section has more room to display text
- Less vertical scrolling needed

### 2. **Improved Readability**
- Multi-column layouts work better
- Item details are easier to scan
- Customer name and notes are more prominent

### 3. **Enhanced User Experience**
- More information visible at once
- Professional appearance with better spacing
- Reduced need for text wrapping

### 4. **Optimal for Notes Section**
The increased width particularly benefits the new notes section:
- Customer name displays clearly
- Multi-line notes have more breathing room
- Better visual hierarchy with additional space

## Visual Impact

### Before (max-w-2xl - ~672px):
```
┌────────────────────────┐
│  Order Details Dialog  │
│  (Narrow, cramped)     │
│  Items wrapped         │
│  Notes compressed      │
└────────────────────────┘
```

### After (max-w-5xl - ~1024px):
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│     Order Details Dialog            │
│  (Spacious, comfortable layout)     │
│  Items displayed side-by-side       │
│  Notes have plenty of room          │
│  Better visual hierarchy            │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Responsive Behavior

The `max-w-5xl` class ensures:
- On large screens: Dialog uses up to 1024px width
- On medium screens: Dialog adapts to available space
- On small screens: Dialog remains responsive and scrollable
- Maintains proper padding and margins

## Content That Benefits

1. **Order Items List**
   - Product names, specifications, prices
   - Better alignment and spacing

2. **Notes Section** (NEW)
   - Customer name display
   - Multi-line notes with proper formatting
   - More comfortable reading experience

3. **Order Details Grid**

   - Professional appearance

4. **Header Information**
   - Order number, customer, badges
   - More breathing room
   - Better visual balance

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Desktop View (>1024px)**
   - Dialog should use full max-w-5xl width
   - Content should be well-spaced
   - No horizontal scrolling

2. **Tablet View (768px-1024px)**
   - Dialog should adapt to screen size
   - Content should remain readable
