# Purchase Invoice Items Flow - Verification

## Current Implementation Status ✅

### 1. Frontend (goods-receipt.tsx)
When goods receipt status is changed to "Complete", the system:
- ✅ Fetches all goods receipt items
- ✅ Maps each item with complete details:
  - goodsReceiptItemId, lpoItemId, itemId, variantId
  - barcode, supplierCode, itemDescription
  - quantity, unitPrice, totalPrice
  - taxRate, taxAmount, discountRate, discountAmount
  - unitOfMeasure
  - storageLocation
  - batchNumber
  - expiryDate
  - condition
  - notes

### 2. API Endpoint (purchase-invoices.ts)
- ✅ Accepts both invoice and items in request body
- ✅ Validates invoice data with insertPurchaseInvoiceSchema
- ✅ Validates items array with insertPurchaseInvoiceItemSchema
- ✅ Passes both to storage layer

### 3. Storage Layer (purchase-invoice-storage.ts)
- ✅ Creates purchase invoice record
- ✅ Inserts all items with purchaseInvoiceId foreign key
- ✅ Returns created invoice

### 4. Display (purchase-invoice-detail.tsx)
- ✅ Enhanced UI showing all item details in professional card layout
- ✅ Displays: description, badges, pricing, batch info, expiry dates, storage location, condition, notes

## Verification Steps

3. Change status to "Complete"
4. System automatically creates Purchase Invoice with all items
5. Navigate to Purchase Invoices page
6. Open the created invoice
7. Verify all item details are displayed:
   - ✅ Item descriptions
   - ✅ Supplier codes and barcodes
   - ✅ Quantities and pricing
   - ✅ Storage locations

The system properly transfers all goods receipt item information to purchase invoices, including:
- Inventory tracking (itemId, variantId, barcode, supplierCode)
- Logistics (storageLocation, batchNumber, expiryDate)
- Quality (condition, notes)
- Pricing (quantity, unitPrice, totalPrice, tax, discount)
- Measurements (unitOfMeasure)
