# Customer Name in Supplier LPO Notes

## Summary
This document outlines the changes made to include customer name in text format within the notes/special instructions field when creating Supplier LPOs from Supplier Quotes.

## Problem Statement
When generating a Supplier LPO from Supplier Quotes, the customer information was not being carried over, making it difficult to identify which customer the purchase order is for.

## Solution
Modified the `createSupplierLposFromSupplierQuotes` function to:
1. Fetch the customer name from the enquiry linked to the supplier quote
2. Add the customer name in text format at the beginning of the notes/special instructions field

## Implementation Details

### File Modified
- `server/storage/supplier-lpo-storage.ts`

### Changes Made

#### 1. Updated Imports
Added `enquiries` and `customers` tables to the imports to enable customer name lookup:
```typescript
import { ..., enquiries, customers, ... } from "@shared/schema";
```

#### 2. Enhanced Quote Selection
Added `enquiryId` to the supplier quote selection query to enable linking to the customer:
```typescript
const quote = await db
  .select({
    ...
    enquiryId: supplierQuotes.enquiryId,
    ...
  })
```

#### 3. Customer Name Lookup
Added logic to fetch customer name from the enquiry:
```typescript
// Get customer name from enquiry if available
let customerName: string | null = null;
const firstQuoteWithEnquiry = quotes.find(q => q.enquiryId);
if (firstQuoteWithEnquiry?.enquiryId) {
  const enquiryResult = await db
    .select({
      customerId: enquiries.customerId,
      customerName: customers.name
    })
    .from(enquiries)
    .leftJoin(customers, eq(enquiries.customerId, customers.id))
    .where(eq(enquiries.id, firstQuoteWithEnquiry.enquiryId))
    .limit(1);
  
  if (enquiryResult[0]?.customerName) {
    customerName = enquiryResult[0].customerName;
  }
}
```

#### 4. Notes Formatting
Modified the notes/special instructions to include customer name in text format:
```typescript
// Prepare notes with customer name
let lpoNotes = supplierQuotes[0].notes || '';
if (customerName) {
  // Add customer name to notes in text format
  const customerInfo = `Customer: ${customerName}`;
  lpoNotes = lpoNotes ? `${customerInfo}\n\n${lpoNotes}` : customerInfo;
}
```

#### 5. LPO Creation
Updated the LPO creation to use the enhanced notes:
```typescript
const lpo = await this.createSupplierLpo({
  ...
  specialInstructions: lpoNotes,  // Contains customer name + original notes
  ...
});
```

## Data Flow

```
Supplier Quote
    ↓ (has enquiryId)
Enquiry
    ↓ (has customerId)
Customer
    ↓ (has name)
Supplier LPO
    ↓ (specialInstructions field)
"Customer: [Customer Name]

[Original Notes from Quote]"
```

## Example Output

If a supplier quote has:
- Customer: "Acme Corporation" (via enquiry)
- Original notes: "Urgent delivery required"

The LPO's special instructions will be:
```
Customer: Acme Corporation

Urgent delivery required
```

## Benefits

1. **Clear Customer Attribution**: LPO now clearly shows which customer it's for
2. **Text Format**: Customer name is in plain text, easy to read and process
3. **Preserved Information**: Original quote notes are retained
4. **Automatic Process**: Customer name is automatically added without manual intervention
5. **Traceability**: Maintains the link between customer enquiry → quote → LPO

## Testing Recommendations

1. Create a customer enquiry
2. Create a supplier quote linked to that enquiry and add some notes
3. Accept the supplier quote
4. Generate an LPO from the accepted quote
5. Verify the LPO's special instructions field contains:
   - "Customer: [Customer Name]" at the top
   - Original quote notes below (if any)

## Edge Cases Handled

- **No Enquiry**: If supplier quote has no enquiry linked, no customer name is added
- **No Customer**: If enquiry exists but has no customer, no customer name is added
- **No Original Notes**: If quote has no notes, only customer name is added
- **Multiple Quotes**: Uses the first quote with an enquiry to get customer name
