# Purchase Invoice - Goods Receipt Integration

## Overview
Enhanced the purchase invoice detail page to fetch and display complete goods receipt information alongside invoice data, providing full visibility into the receiving process.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Data Fetching
**Added two data sources:**

**a) Invoice Items Query:**
```typescript
const { data: invoiceItems = [] } = useQuery<PurchaseInvoiceItem[]>({
  queryKey: ["/api/purchase-invoices", id, "items"],
  enabled: !!id,
  queryFn: async () => {
    const resp = await fetch(`/api/purchase-invoices/${id}/items`);
    return resp.json();
  }
});
```

**b) Goods Receipt Items Query:**
```typescript
const { data: goodsReceiptItems = [] } = useQuery<any[]>({
  queryKey: ["/api/goods-receipt-headers", invoice?.goodsReceiptId, "items"],
  enabled: !!invoice?.goodsReceiptId,
  queryFn: async () => {
    const resp = await fetch(`/api/goods-receipt-headers/${invoice?.goodsReceiptId}/items`);
    return resp.json();
  }
});
```

### 2. Data Enrichment
Merged both data sources to create enriched items with complete information:

```typescript
const enrichedItems = invoiceItems.map(invItem => {
  const grItem = goodsReceiptItems.find((gr: any) => gr.id === invItem.goodsReceiptItemId);
  return {
    ...invItem,
    quantityExpected: grItem?.quantityExpected,
    quantityReceived: grItem?.quantityReceived,
    quantityDamaged: grItem?.quantityDamaged,
    quantityShort: grItem?.quantityShort,
    discrepancyReason: grItem?.discrepancyReason,
    scannedAt: grItem?.scannedAt,
    receivedAt: grItem?.receivedAt,
  };
});
```

### 3. Enhanced Display

#### New Goods Receipt Details Section
Added a dedicated indigo-colored section showing receiving information:

**Features:**
- üì¶ **Expected Quantity** - What was ordered

- üü† **Short Quantity** - Missing items
- üìù **Discrepancy Reason** - Explanation for differences
- üïí **Timestamps** - Scanned and received dates/times

#### Complete Item Information Display

**1. Item Header:**
- Item icon badge
- Item description
- Color-coded badges:
  - ÔøΩÔøΩ Supplier Code
  - üü£ Barcode

**2. Goods Receipt Details Section (Indigo):**
