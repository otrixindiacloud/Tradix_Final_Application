# Invoice Lookup - Fixed Error Handling ‚úÖ

## Issue
When uploading a document and the extracted invoice number doesn't exist in the database, the system was showing a 500 error overlay that broke the UI.

## Root Cause
The `apiRequest()` function automatically throws errors for non-OK responses. When the invoice wasn't found (404 or 500), the error was propagating to the UI and showing the error overlay.

## Solution Implemented

### Updated `fetchInvoiceDetails()` Function
```typescript
// Before: Would throw errors and break UI
try {
  const response = await apiRequest(...)
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(...)  // This broke the UI
  }
}

// After: Gracefully handles errors
try {
  const response = await apiRequest(...)
  const data = await response.json()
  // ... process data
} catch (error) {
  // Log error but don't throw
  console.error('[fetchInvoiceDetails] Error:', error)
  setInvoiceFetchError(message)
  setInvoiceDetails(null)
  // Return false instead of throwing
  return false
}
```

### Updated `extractReceiptData()` Function
```typescript
// Now checks return value instead of catching exceptions
const fetchSuccess = await fetchInvoiceDetails(extractedInvoiceNumber)

if (fetchSuccess) {
  // Invoice found and loaded
} else {
  // Invoice not found - show friendly message
  toast({
    title: "Invoice Number Extracted",
    description: "Found invoice but not in system. Please verify or enter manually."
  })
}
```

## How It Works Now

### Scenario 1: Invoice Exists ‚úÖ
```
1. Upload document with "Invoice No: PI-20251006-JM577"
2. OCR extracts: "PI-20251006-JM577"
3. Search database ‚Üí Found!
4. Auto-fill all fields + items
5. Show success message
```

### Scenario 2: Invoice Doesn't Exist ‚úÖ
```
1. Upload document with "Invoice No: PI-20251006-JM577"
2. OCR extracts: "PI-20251006-JM577"
3. Search database ‚Üí Not found (500 error happens here)
4. Catch error gracefully
5. Show friendly message: "Invoice extracted but not in system"
6. Pre-fill invoice number in lookup field
7. User can manually enter details
8. NO ERROR OVERLAY! UI remains usable ‚úÖ
```

## Testing

### To Test Success Case:
1. Create a purchase invoice first with number "PI-20251006-JM577"
2. Upload a document with that invoice number
3. Click "Next"
4. Should see: ‚úÖ All details auto-filled

### To Test Error Case (Current Situation):
1. Upload a document with any invoice number
2. Click "Next"
3. Should see: ‚ö†Ô∏è Friendly message "Invoice not in system"
4. Form remains usable, no error overlay
5. Invoice number is pre-filled in lookup field

## What's Different

### Before ‚ùå
- Error overlay appears
- Red error message blocks the UI
- User can't proceed
- Form is unusable

### After ‚úÖ
- Friendly notification appears
- UI remains functional
- User can continue with manual entry
- Invoice number is pre-filled for reference

## Next Steps

To get full auto-fill functionality:
1. Go to "Purchase Invoices" page
2. Create a new invoice with the extracted number
3. Upload the document again
4. All details will auto-fill! üéâ
