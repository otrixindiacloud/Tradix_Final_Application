# Quick Fix Applied ✅

## What Was Fixed

The error you saw was happening because:
1. The OCR successfully extracted an invoice number from your document
2. The system tried to fetch that invoice from the database
3. The invoice didn't exist, causing a 500 error
4. The error was thrown, breaking the UI and showing the error overlay

## Changes Made

### 1. Better Error Handling in `fetchInvoiceDetails()`
- Changed from throwing errors to returning boolean (`true`/`false`)
- Returns `false` when invoice not found (instead of throwing)
- Only shows toast notification when manually clicked, not during auto-extraction

### 2. Updated `extractReceiptData()` 
- Now checks the return value of `fetchInvoiceDetails()`
- Handles "not found" gracefully with user-friendly message
- Pre-fills the invoice number field so user can see what was extracted
- Continues to Step 2 without breaking

## How It Works Now

### Scenario 1: Invoice Found ✅
```
Upload document → OCR extracts "PI-20251006-JM577"
   ↓
Search database → Found!
   ↓
Auto-fill all details + items
   ↓
Show success message
```

### Scenario 2: Invoice NOT Found ⚠️ (Fixed!)
```
Upload document → OCR extracts "PI-20251006-JM577"
   ↓
Search database → Not found
   ↓
Show friendly message: "Found invoice 'PI-20251006-JM577' but not in system"
   ↓
Pre-fill invoice lookup field with extracted number
   ↓
User can verify and enter details manually
   ↓
NO ERROR OVERLAY! ✅
```

## What You'll See Now

When you upload a document:

1. **Document processes successfully** ✅
2. **If invoice found**: All details auto-fill
3. **If invoice NOT found**: 
   - Friendly notification appears
   - Invoice number is pre-filled in the lookup field
   - You can manually enter details
   - **No red error screen!** ✅

## Test It Now

1. Upload your PDF with "Invoice No: PI-20251006-JM577"
2. Click "Next"
3. You should see:
   - Either: Success message (if invoice exists)
   - Or: "Invoice number extracted but not in system" message
   - The form remains usable
   - No error overlay!
