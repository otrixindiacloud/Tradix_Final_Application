# OCR Invoice Extraction - Implementation Complete! üéâ

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Server-Side OCR & PDF Text Extraction**
Created `/server/routes/document-extraction.ts` with:
- **Tesseract.js OCR** for extracting text from images (JPG, PNG, etc.)
- **PDF-Parse** for extracting text from PDF documents
- **Smart Pattern Matching** to find invoice numbers in extracted text
- Supports patterns like:
  - `Invoice No : PI-20251006-JM577`
  - `Invoice Number: INV-123456`
  - `Bill No: 345678`
  - And many more variations

### 2. **Client-Side Integration**
Updated `client/src/pages/receipts.tsx`:
- **Two-Tier Extraction**:
  1. **Primary**: OCR/PDF text extraction from document content
  2. **Fallback**: Pattern matching from filename
- Automatic invoice lookup in database
- Auto-population of all form fields and line items
- Real-time progress indicators
- Comprehensive error handling

### 3. **New API Endpoint**
- `POST /api/documents/extract-invoice`
  - Accepts file upload (PDF or image)
  - Returns extracted invoice number
  - Includes text preview for debugging

## How to Test

### Step 1: Create a Test Invoice
You need to have an invoice in your database first. You can:

#### Option A: Use the UI
1. Go to Purchase Invoices page
2. Create a new invoice with number `PI-20251006-JM577`
3. Add some line items
4. Save it

#### Option B: Use existing invoices
- Use any invoice number already in your system
- Make sure you know the exact invoice number

### Step 2: Prepare a Test Document
Create a test document with the invoice number:

#### For Testing OCR (Images):
Create a simple image with text like:
```
PURCHASE INVOICE

Invoice No : PI-20251006-JM577
Date: October 10, 2025
Supplier: Test Supplier Ltd
```

Save as `test-invoice.jpg` or `test-invoice.png`

#### For Testing PDF:
Create a PDF with the same text content

### Step 3: Test the Feature
1. Go to **Receipts** page
2. Click **"New Receipt"**
3. **Step 1**: Upload your test document
   - You'll see the file preview
   - Info message about intelligent processing
4. Click **"Next"**
   - System will process the document
   - OCR/PDF extraction happens automatically
   - If invoice found: All details auto-fill!
   - If not found: Message shows extracted number

### Step 4: Verify Results
Check that:
- ‚úÖ Invoice number was extracted correctly
- ‚úÖ Invoice details populated in form
- ‚úÖ Line items appeared in Step 3
- ‚úÖ Supplier information is correct

## Testing Different Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Perfect Match (Best Case)
```
Document contains: "Invoice No : PI-20251006-JM577"
Database has: Invoice PI-20251006-JM577
Result: ‚úÖ All details auto-filled, items loaded
```

### Scenario 2: Invoice Not in Database
```
Document contains: "Invoice No : PI-99999999-TEST"
Database: Invoice doesn't exist
Result: ‚ö†Ô∏è Message: "Found invoice 'PI-99999999-TEST' but not in system"
         Invoice number pre-filled in lookup field
         User can enter details manually
```

### Scenario 3: No Clear Invoice Number in Document
```
Document: Generic receipt with no clear invoice format
Result: ‚ö†Ô∏è Falls back to filename pattern matching
        Or prompts for manual entry
```

### Scenario 4: PDF Document
```
Document: PDF with text "Invoice Number: INV-001"
Result: ‚úÖ Fast text extraction, no OCR needed
        Auto-fills if invoice exists
```

### Scenario 5: Image with Poor Quality
```
Document: Blurry photo
Result: ‚ö†Ô∏è OCR may struggle, takes longer
        May not find invoice number
        User can enter manually
```

## Expected Behavior

### When Upload Document in Step 1:
```
User uploads ‚Üí Click "Next"
  ‚Üì
System processes document
  ‚Üì
Text extraction (OCR/PDF)
  ‚Üì
Pattern matching for invoice number
  ‚Üì
Found? ‚Üí Search database
  ‚Üì
Exists? ‚Üí Auto-fill everything
  ‚Üì
Show success message with details
```

### Console Logs to Watch:
```javascript
[extractReceiptData] Processing uploaded file: test-invoice.jpg
[extractReceiptData] Sending document for text extraction...
[EXTRACT-INVOICE] Request received
[extractTextFromImage] Processing image with OCR...
[OCR Progress] 50%
[OCR Progress] 100%
[extractInvoiceNumber] Found invoice number: PI-20251006-JM577
[fetchInvoiceDetails] Fetching invoice: PI-20251006-JM577
[fetchInvoiceDetails] Fetched invoice data: {...}
[fetchInvoiceDetails] Setting receipt items: [...]
```

## Quick Test Without Creating Invoice

If you don't have any invoices in the system yet:

1. Upload any document with text like "Invoice No : TEST-001"
2. System will extract "TEST-001"
3. You'll see message: "Found invoice 'TEST-001' but no matching record"
4. The invoice lookup field will be pre-filled with "TEST-001"
5. You can then manually enter all details

This proves the OCR is working! üéâ

## Troubleshooting

### "500 Error: Failed to fetch purchase invoice"
**Cause**: Invoice doesn't exist in database
**Solution**: Create the invoice first, or use manual entry

### OCR not finding invoice number
**Cause**: 
- Document text is unclear
- Invoice format not recognized
**Solution**: 
- Try clearer document
- Use manual invoice lookup field
- Check console for extracted text preview

### Slow processing
**Cause**: OCR takes time (10-30 seconds for images)
**Expected**: Progress indicator shows status
**Solution**: Wait for completion, or use PDF instead

## Next Steps

1. **Create test invoice** in Purchase Invoices
2. **Upload document** with that invoice number
3. **Watch the magic** happen! ‚ú®
